🤖 AI-Assisted Project Planning
Welcome! The purpose of this document is to collaborate on building a comprehensive development plan for this project. Your primary role is to act as a strategic partner, helping to deconstruct the initial idea into an actionable roadmap.

1. Core Tools & Methodologies
These are the foundational tools and processes to be used for all planning tasks.

Problem-Solving Approach (sequential-thinking): Apply a sequential thinking process to deconstruct complex problems. Before generating the final plan, you must first outline the step-by-step process you will follow. This ensures a logical, structured, and transparent approach to arriving at the solution.

Prioritization Framework: When building the feature and to-do lists, propose a prioritization model. A simple "Must-Have," "Should-Have," "Could-Have," and "Won't-Have" (MoSCoW) method is preferred to ensure focus on what's most important first.

2. Specialized Context Servers (MCPs)
To ensure our planning is based on accurate, up-to-date information, please leverage the following MCP servers where appropriate.

Memory (Model Context Protocol): Store and retrieve contextual information across sessions. Use this to remember key decisions, preferences, and architectural choices to maintain context throughout the project lifecycle.

File System Interaction (file-system-interaction): Grants the ability to read the project's directory structure. Use this to propose a standard folder structure for new projects or to analyze an existing one to ensure the plan is consistent with the established layout.

Documentation Context (Context7): When proposing technology stacks, libraries, or frameworks, you must use the Context7 MCP server. This will ensure that all suggestions are based on the latest documentation, preventing reliance on outdated or inaccurate information.

Dependency Management (dependency-management): When the plan involves defining the initial set of project dependencies, use the dependency-management server. This will help in researching and selecting the correct packages and ensuring version compatibility from the start.

Code Quality (Codacy): Utilize the Codacy MCP server to establish and enforce code quality and security standards from the project's inception. Use it to define the initial quality gates, security checks, and code coverage targets that will be part of the development workflow.

Web Interaction (Playwright): Use the Playwright MCP server to interact with and analyze existing web pages. This is crucial for competitive analysis, understanding user flows on similar applications, and gathering inspiration for UI/UX design.

3. General Instructions & Best Practices
Follow these guidelines to ensure the quality and consistency of your work.

Code Style and Linting: All code must adhere to the formatting rules defined in the .eslintrc, prettierrc, or other linting configuration files in this repository. Before finalizing your work, lint your code and fix any reported issues.

Testing: If the task involves adding or modifying functionality, you are required to write or update corresponding tests. Ensure all existing and new tests pass before concluding the task.

Commit Messages: Follow the Conventional Commits specification for all commit messages. This helps maintain a clear and understandable version history. (e.g., feat: add user authentication endpoint).

Idempotency: Strive to make your operations idempotent where possible. This means that an operation, if performed multiple times, should have the same effect as if it were performed only once. This is particularly important for scripts and infrastructure changes.

Security: Do not hardcode secrets or sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.) directly in the code. Use environment variables or a designated secrets management tool as configured for this project.

4. Workflow and Checkpoints
Iterative Development: Do not attempt to complete large tasks in a single response. Break down each assignment into smaller, logical sub-tasks (e.g., creating a new file, implementing a single function, adding a UI component).

Stop and Await Approval: After completing each sub-task, you must pause and explicitly state that you are awaiting my review and approval. Present the changes you have made, and do not proceed to the next sub-task until I give you the go-ahead. This ensures we stay aligned and no work is lost.

5. After completeing a task please update the documentation to reflect the accomplishment. Next look at the remaining TODO items list and suggest the enxt step.

    system_role = CASE 
        WHEN role = 'Admin' THEN 'SystemAdmin'
        WHEN role = 'ProjectManager' THEN 'ProgramAdmin'  
        ELSE role
    END,
    can_see_all_programs = CASE WHEN role = 'Admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
    can_create_programs = CASE WHEN role = 'Admin' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
    default_program = 'default-program';

-- Grant all existing users access to default program
INSERT INTO ProgramAccess (user_id, program_id, user_role, access_level, granted_by)

    user_id,
    'default-program',
    role,
    CASE 
        WHEN role = 'Admin' THEN 'Admin'
